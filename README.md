# EmuCrate

This might be the final name, who knows?

What is the goal of this project? Well currently it is just in the UI stages of development but there's a lot of promise. 

The goal is to create a frontend similar to launchbox, but allow people to download and launch emulators from the UI. We plan to only support Windows and Linux for now, however I'm not opposed to someone adding support for MacOS if it doesn't interfere with the other platforms.
This project is completely free and was made because there's barely any emulator managers for Linux. Launchbox is the closest we have to that and even then it's not great. 

We also have a checklist.md file which will be updated with planned features in the future.

Support is appreciated!
