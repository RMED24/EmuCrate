# EmuRunPreAlpha

This is *not* the final name. I hate it...

Okay now we've cleared that up, what is the goal of this project? Well currently it is just in the UI stages of development but there's a lot of promise. 

The goal is to create a frontend similar to launchbox, but allow people to download and launch emulators from the UI. We plan to only support Windows and Linux for now, however I'm not opposed to someone adding support for MacOS if it doesn't interfere with the other platforms.
